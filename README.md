# Orbit Transfers Mission Analysis

This project was developed as part of the course **Introduzione all’analisi di missioni spaziali** (A.A. 2023-2024).

## Overview
The aim of this project is to analyse different strategies for transferring between a "low MEO" parking orbit and a "MEO" target orbit.  
Several approaches were tested using **MATLAB**, comparing performance in terms of Δv and transfer time.  

Strategies analysed:
1. Standard transfer strategy
2. Alternative Transfer 1 – Step inversion
3. Alternative Transfer 2 – Time reduction
4. Alternative Transfer 3 – Reduced plane change Δv

- `src/`: MATLAB scripts and functions
- `figures/`: Graphical results of the orbits and transfer strategies
